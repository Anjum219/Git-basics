git stash is very useful when you are working in a branch and 
you need to switch to a different branch immediately. You are 
not ready to commit your code yet. Here comes the helping hand
of git stash. At first, just stage the files

  $ git add .
  
Now all your files are staged. You will use git stash now

  $ git stash
  
That's it. All your changes are stashed. Now you are free to roam
aroound in any branch you like. You can also stash the changes 
with a message

  $ git stash save "save message"
  
Now, time to restore the changes. Checkout to the relevant branch 
and write

  $ git stash apply
  
It will apply the latest stash in the current branch. If you 
need to apply a different stash, you camn do so using

  $ git stash apply <stash_id>
  
stash_id can be known by writing the command-

  $ git stash list
  
It will show the list of all stashes with their id. The id is 
generally with the format "stash@{1}"
