Merge conflict may occur when we work on different branches
and try to merge the commits of local branch to remote branch. 
Or it may occur while trying to rebase the local branch with 
remote branch, since there can be files with conflicts. VS code 
shows the changes in the conflicting file. You can use the 
editor to resolve conflicts. Sometimes we need to resolve it 
manually. After manually editing the file, do the following-

  $ git add <file_name>
  
Now, if you were trying to merge your local branch in remote,

  $ git push <remote> <local_branch>
  
Or if you were trying to rebase your local branch with remote,

  $ git rebase --continue
