To access a lot of features in git interactive mode-

  $ git rebase -i HEAD~<no_of_commits>
  
Now, in place of "pick", type the suggested keywords to apply
required changes. For example, to squash the 5th commit with the
4th, erase the "pick" before 5th commit and type "s". Then press
Ctrl+S. Then Ctrl+X to exit. After, a message is shown. Then 
again, Ctrl+X.
